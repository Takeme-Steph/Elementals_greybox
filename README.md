## Game Overview

Elementals is a project born out of a desire to create a captivating RPG experience that stands out. In this game, you'll step into the shoes of an earth mage, embarking on an epic journey in a semi-open world. The objective? To gain mastery over the basic elements and discover new ones, starting with conquering the menacing green dragon and harness newfound elemental powers. This game is designed to be more than just a simple RPGâ€”it's a proof of concept that showcases my ability to craft immersive game worlds, intricate character progression, and engaging battles. I will add more features, a robust storyline, and more engaging gameplay as I progress in my game development journey.

## Complexity

- Elementals has 4 scenes, a start scene, a play scene, a win scene and a lose scene.
- There is a fair amount of world space for the player to explore.
- There is an enemy that can be defeated to win the game.
- There is a main player character equiped with a weapon and an attack action which has vfx.
- Both enemy and player have health point that are depleted by attacks from each other.
- Player attack power depends on the strenght of the player.
- The enemy dragon has the ability to fight back.

Scripts were written in a way that allows them to be reusable accross different players and enemies, as well as allow for growth and progression of the player. This is to enable me expand on this greybox and eventually build a more robust rpg.
